							<h1>EMPATHY</h1>
							<p>
								A basic prerequisite for being plant-conscious is
								<b>developing empathy for plants.</b> You could see empathy as a
								<b>
									bridge for two life forms to start exchanging valuable
									information in a proper manner.</b
								>
								I bet you would learn more from a coach you respect deeply, than
								from a person you dislike. You should be educated and personally
								in touch with the subject, as you cannot develop empathy for
								something you do not encounter in daily life.<br /><br />
								It is a hopeful fact that (plant) empathy is a skill that can be
								learned. It can even be exercised by simple acts like keeping
								houseplants, which is proven to improve your overall wellbeing.
								Other methods of developing empathy for plants are gardening and
								visiting forests, botanical gardens or nurseries. Seek for other
								plant enthusiasts and spread the love!
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h1>SCIENCE</h1>
							<p>
								<b>The most reliable tool we own is science.</b>
								Our knowledge of plants is evolving rapidly. We are starting to
								discover how complex and strategic plants are.<br /><br />
								<b
									>Experiments on individual specimens conclude that plants can
									probably see, hear, feel, remember, count, talk, and even
									calculate probability in some way.</b
								>
								These abilities are, of course, personified; they do not operate
								with the same mechanisms as humans do. This growing field of
								research motivated scientists to talk, provocatively, about
								<b>plant neurology.</b> Which, is, of course, an oxymoron given
								that plants have no nervous system.<br /><br />
								We now look at plants with more knowledge, increasingly
								discovering the inherent nature of that life form. And in turn,
								this new knowledge challenges us to scrutinise our understanding
								of
								<b>plant science as a whole.</b>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
							<p>
								As much as we would like to know certain facts,
								<b>some things will remain a mystery.</b>
								Science has a hard time proving
								<b
									>some truths, by example emotional, ethical or existential
									values.</b
								>
								For these topics and other unexplained subjects, we use
								<b>philosophy to dig deeper.</b><br /><br />
								We search for patterns and logical links, while listening
								carefully to each other. Our discussions are largely fuelled by
								our
								<b>intuitive thoughts on plants, personal experience</b>
								and top-notch
								<b
									>plant consciousness information coming from authors,
									botanists and recent studies.</b
								>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h1>DURABILITY</h1>
							<p>
								While working closely with
								<b
									>plants, we strive to develop strategies for a green future.
									Ecology is getting more important by the day.</b
								>
								With the ability to grow just with the energy of the sun,
								<b
									>plants are at the base of every animal that lives on
									Earth.</b
								>
								They cleanse the soil, purify the air and provide
								<b>food, medicine, building materials and so much more.</b
								><br /><br />
								<b
									>Currently, one thirth of all plant species are vulnerable and
									loss of ecosystems is a major problem worldwide.</b
								>
								We are seeing a worldwide switch from
								<b>wild organisms to cultivated species.</b>
								This evolution seems inevitable in our modern society, yet we
								can make this switch in a mindful way. We are convinced that
								<b
									>humans can create a durable future with healthy agriculture,
									healthy wildlife like bees and butterflies and safely keep
									endangered species.</b
								>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h1>THE ART OF GARDENING</h1>
							<p>
								<b>Gardening is an act of love.</b> It works
								<b
									>therapeutical, antidepressant and it is a natural form of
									fitness.</b
								>
								Gardening combines
								<b>knowledge and intuition.</b> One raises plants in a unique
								microclimate, together with other plants, animals and fungi. The
								soil is the base where fungi can make the impossible possible by
								their sometimes kilometre-long range. The gardener stands at the
								forefront of decision making concerning
								<b
									>plant combinations regarding geometrical shapes, (flower)
									colours, heights and vitality.</b
								><br /><br />
								With every act of work, the utopian garden in his imaginative
								mind and his real garden come a little closer to each other.
								This can result in a garden containing
								<b
									>some of the most beautiful art, inspiring even the most
									famous painters.</b
